		<h2> Thomas Edward Patrick </h2>
		<p>
Thomas Edward Patrick "Tom" Brady, Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American football quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL).<br><br>

After playing college football for the University of Michigan, he was drafted by the Patriots in the 6th round of the 2000 NFL draft. In Brady's 13 seasons as a starter, the Patriots have earned six trips to the Super Bowl, winning three. He has also won two Super Bowl MVP awards, two league MVP awards (2007, 2010), has been selected to ten Pro Bowls, and has led the Patriots to more division titles than any other quarterback in NFL history, with twelve. Brady is fifth on the all time list for career passing yards and fifth for career touchdown passes. His career postseason record is 20–8; his playoff win total is the highest in NFL history. He helped set the record for the longest consecutive win streak in NFL history with 21 straight wins over two seasons (2003–2004). He also set the record for most consecutive playoff wins with 10, and in 2007 led the Patriots to the first undefeated regular season since the institution of the 16-game schedule. He has thrown for more passing yards and touchdowns than any quarterback in NFL postseason history, and has the sixth highest career passer rating of all time (95.9) among quarterbacks with at least 1,500 career passing attempts.<br><br>

Brady and Joe Montana are the only two players in NFL history to win the NFL Most Valuable Player and Super Bowl MVP awards multiple times. Brady is the only quarterback to lead his team to six Super Bowls. He was also named the NFL MVP in 2007 and 2010 (becoming the first player to be unanimously chosen as MVP in the 2010 season) as well as 2007 Male Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press, the first time an NFL player has been so honored since Joe Montana won the award in 1990. After the 2010 season, Brady was ranked as the best player in the NFL. He was also the first quarterback to throw for 50 or more touchdowns in a season. In 2010, he set the all time record for consecutive passes without an interception, and broke his own record for season TD:INT ratio at 9:1 (which has since been broken by Nick Foles).<br><br>

He and Bill Belichick have combined to form one of the most successful quarterback-coach tandems in NFL history, winning 160 regular season games and 20 postseason games together, as well as appearing in six Super Bowls together, all NFL records.<br><br>
Brady was born in San Mateo, California, the only son and fourth child of Galynn Patricia (née Johnson) and Thomas Brady, Sr.[3] He has three older sisters.He was raised Catholic, and is of Irish descent on his father's side and of Polish, Norwegian, and Swedish descent on his mother's side. Brady regularly attended 49ers games at Candlestick Park in the 1980s, where he became a fan of quarterback Joe Montana; since then, Brady has mentioned Montana as one of his inspirations and an idol.[10] One of the games Brady attended was the 1981 NFC Championship against the Dallas Cowboys, in which Montana threw The Catch to Dwight Clark, with Brady only being four-years-old at the time.[11] Brady attended football camp at the College of San Mateo as a kid, where he learned to throw the football from camp counselor, and American football quarterback, Tony Graziani.[12] Brady grew up as a Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics fan.<br><br>

Brady attended Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, California, graduating in 1995 at St. Mary's Cathedral.[14] While at Serra, Brady played football, basketball, and baseball. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady was drafted as a catcher in the 18th round of the 1995 MLB Draft by the Montreal Expos.<br><br>

During the summer of 1998 and 1999, Brady was an intern at Merrill Lynch.<br><br>

In 2004, Brady was inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame. When Brady revisited two weeks after Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, it was announced[by whom?] that the school had named the football stadium Brady Family Stadium.<br><br>
